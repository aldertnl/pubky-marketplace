/**
 * Lazily fetches live auction state (current bid, bid count, reserve status)
 * for ONE catalog card from the durable transaction service's public listing
 * projection — the only authoritative source for bids, which the Nexus index
 * deliberately never carries.
 *
 * Cost model: the durable service exposes only per-listing reads
 * (`GET /v1/listings/{aggregate_id}`, no batch endpoint), so an eager fetch
 * per grid row would issue N requests on every catalog render. Instead the
 * card registers an IntersectionObserver via `ref` and fetches ONCE when it
 * first scrolls into view (200px pre-fetch margin), so off-screen cards cost
 * nothing. The value is a point-in-time read, not a live subscription — the
 * detail page's `useMarketplaceProjection` remains the polling surface.
 *
 * Scope: `transaction-service` mode only. The sandbox keeps terms-only cards;
 * its simulated bid state stays on the detail page where it is labeled as
 * such. Failures (no session yet, service unreachable, non-auction
 * projection) leave `bid` null and the card falls back to the seller's terms
 * from the index — never a fabricated bid.
