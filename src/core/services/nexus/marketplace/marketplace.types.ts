 * Nexus marketplace types
 *
 * Mirror the response shapes served by the Nexus marketplace index
 * (`nexus-common/src/models/marketplace/*` on the `feat/marketplace-indexing`
 * branch of pubky-nexus). Field names are snake_case exactly as serialized by
 * Nexus; enum values follow the snake_case serde renames in `pubky-app-specs`.
 *
 * These are lossy read projections of the owner-signed homeserver records —
 * they carry the record's media URIs (`media_urls`) but none of the per-media
 * metadata (type, dimensions, alt text), no variants, shipping options, or
 * return policy, so they can never be written into the `commerce_listings` /
 * `commerce_shops` record caches directly. The homeserver stays canonical for record content
 * (ADR-0020); Nexus provides discovery, ordering, and revision freshness.
 *
 * The projection does carry the sale terms a catalog card needs: the primary
 * price (the unit price for fixed-price listings, the starting price for
 * auctions) and, for auctions, the `auction_*` term fields. It never carries
 * live auction state (current bid, bid count) — bids live in the transaction
 * service's listing projection, not in the listing record Nexus indexes.

 * `verified_count` is the subset whose embedded purchase attestation
 * cryptographically verified at ingest (compact-JWS parse, Ed25519
